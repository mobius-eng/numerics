# Criteria

Criteria is a method of controlling the iterations in `fixed-point` method. Criteria can specify
when to finish the method or when to fail it. It can also provide a way of logging the values
as the iteration progresses. Different criteria can be combined using `combine` function.

More documentation on particular criteria functions is coming.
